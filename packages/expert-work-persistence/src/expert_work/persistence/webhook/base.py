"""Abstract ``WebhookEndpointStore`` + ``WebhookDeliveryStore`` — HX-9 (STREAM-HX § 13).

The durable registry of outbound webhook endpoints (``webhook_endpoint``)
and the delivery queue / DLQ (``webhook_delivery``). The CRUD API uses the
tenant-scoped methods; the delivery worker uses the cross-tenant scans
(:meth:`WebhookEndpointStore.list_enabled_all_tenants` /
:meth:`WebhookDeliveryStore.claim_ready`), entering an RLS-bypass context
(``bypass_rls_var``) around them — a fleet of worker replicas shares the
same cross-tenant scan, ``claim_ready``'s CAS handing each row to exactly
one replica (W1-PR1); per-delivery work re-scopes to the row's own tenant.

Implementations:
