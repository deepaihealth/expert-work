"""``NasWorkspaceStore`` — NAS-mounted :class:`WorkspaceStore` (sandbox migration wave 2).

**Why a direct filesystem implementation.** Wave 1's ``SupervisorWorkspaceStore``
proxies every workspace-file operation over HTTP because the control-plane
process cannot otherwise reach a per-user docker volume — only the
sandbox-supervisor host can. Wave 2 replaces the docker-volume workspace
with a shared NAS volume (Alibaba Cloud NAS via the CSI driver) that is
mounted **whole-tree** into the control-plane Pod itself (see wave 2 Task 2's
``workspace-nas`` PV/PVC + the control-plane Deployment's volume mount) —
so the control-plane no longer needs a network hop to read or write a
user's files. This store implements the same :class:`WorkspaceStore`
Protocol by operating on ``self.root`` (the Pod-local mount point, e.g.
``/mnt/workspaces``) with :mod:`os` ``dir_fd``-relative syscalls; per-tenant
/per-user layout is ``{root}/{tenant_id}/{user_id}/...``, matching the
sandbox side's ``subPath: "<tenant_id>/<user_id>"`` projection of the same
volume (wave 2 Task 4/6) — a sandbox writing under ``/workspace`` and this
store reading ``{root}/{tenant_id}/{user_id}`` see the same files.

**Parity contract with SupervisorWorkspaceStore.** Both implementations must
behave identically at the :class:`WorkspaceStore` Protocol boundary — same
error type (:class:`SandboxSupervisorError`), same path-validation rules,
same size caps, same reserved-prefix filtering — so that swapping the
factory's choice of backend (``build_workspace_store``, keyed off
``Settings.workspace_nas_root``) never changes agent-visible behaviour. The
cap / filter constants below intentionally mirror
``sandbox_supervisor.supervisor``'s ``_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES`` /
``_MAX_WORKSPACE_WRITE_BYTES`` / ``_MAX_WORKSPACE_LIST_ENTRIES`` — they are
re-declared here (not imported) because ``orchestrator`` and
``sandbox-supervisor`` are independent services with no runtime dependency
on each other; wave 2 Task 7's contract-test suite is what pins the two
implementations together and would catch a drift.

**Marker semantics.** :meth:`NasWorkspaceStore.mark_deleted` is a
*soft*-delete: it drops an empty :data:`DELETED_MARKER` sentinel file at the
user's workspace root and nothing else — no file is removed, no bytes are
freed. This mirrors the supervisor's ``mark_workspace_deleted`` (Mini-ADR
J-36): the marker is what lets a later sweep recognise "this workspace was
soft-deleted" before it actually reclaims the storage. That hard-delete /
archive step is wave 3's job, not this store's — :meth:`list_files` hides
the marker (and the reserved ``skills/`` / ``uploads/`` prefixes) from the
browse view, but the underlying files stay on disk until the archive chain
runs. Because :data:`DELETED_MARKER` is a plain filename inside the tree
this store otherwise treats as agent-writable, :meth:`write_file` and
:meth:`delete_file` both explicitly refuse a request whose path equals it
— an agent (or a caller replaying an untrusted path) could otherwise
directly delete the marker (silently undoing a soft-delete outside the
purge flow) or fabricate it (forging "this workspace was soft-deleted"
without ever calling :meth:`mark_deleted`). Neither of those is the
``is_reserved_workspace_path`` prefix check's job — the marker lives at the
workspace *root*, not under a reserved directory prefix.

**TOCTOU note.** The NAS volume is the same tree a sandbox mounts (subPath-
scoped to its own ``{tenant_id}/{user_id}``) and *runs untrusted code
against* — a malicious run sharing this control-plane's view of the wider
tree can plant a symlink anywhere under its own subtree to redirect a
later operation outside it (a cross-tenant escape, not just a same-user
footgun). An earlier version of this module validated a path once with
``Path.resolve()`` (following symlinks) and then reopened it by
**re-walking the same string path** for the actual ``mkdir`` / ``open`` /
``unlink`` — even with a freshly-repeated check immediately beforehand, the
kernel still resolves *every* intermediate component of that string from
scratch on the follow-up syscall, so a concurrent writer racing in a
symlink for *any* intermediate component (not just the final one) between
the check and the operation was never actually closed off; a symlink at the
final component only narrows the window, it does not eliminate it. That
includes ``delete_file``: ``unlink()`` never dereferences a symlink at its
*final* component, but it does dereference symlinks in every component
*before* the final one while resolving the string path — so a mid-chain
swap turns ``delete_file`` into a cross-tenant arbitrary-delete primitive
just as surely as it turns ``write_file``/``read_file`` into a cross-tenant
arbitrary-write/read primitive. (An earlier revision of this note claimed
``delete_file`` was structurally immune for this reason; that reasoning
only covered the final component and was wrong about the intermediate
ones — corrected here.)

The actual fix is to never re-walk a string path at all.
:meth:`_open_parent_dir_fd` resolves ``path`` one component at a time using
``dir_fd``-relative ``openat()`` (:func:`os.open` with ``dir_fd=``),
starting from a directory fd opened for the trusted ``{root}/{tenant_id}/
{user_id}`` prefix (``tenant_id``/``user_id`` are UUIDs from the
authenticated caller, never attacker-controlled path text, so opening that
prefix via a plain path string needs no extra guarding — matching how the
sandbox's own subPath mount is scoped to exactly this same prefix). Each
step opens with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` — a symlink at *that* component makes the
``openat()`` itself fail (``ELOOP``) rather than being followed — and, once
opened, a directory fd is *pinned to the inode it was opened from*: nothing
that happens afterwards to that name in its parent (a rename, an unlink, a
symlink swapped in under the same name) can redirect operations already
using that fd. The final read / write / delete all happen relative to the
last fd in the chain (``os.open(name, ..., dir_fd=parent_fd)`` /
``os.unlink(name, dir_fd=parent_fd)``), so there is no remaining step that
re-resolves a string path — the class of race this note describes has no
foothold left, for any of read/write/delete, at any path depth. This is not
airtight against every conceivable race (e.g. a mkdir-then-immediate-reopen
retry inside :meth:`_openat_dir` when creating a missing directory is two
syscalls, not one — but that reopen also carries ``O_NOFOLLOW``, so even
that narrow window fails closed rather than open), but it eliminates the
specific mechanism (re-walking a string path) that made the previous
version's re-checks ineffective.

:meth:`list_files` is a narrower case: it only reads metadata, never opens
file content, and its :func:`os.walk` call passes ``followlinks=False`` so
it never *descends into* a symlinked subdirectory (an intermediate-
component escape of the kind described above can't make it enumerate files
outside the tree). A symlink placed as a plain file entry (not a directory)
still appears in the listing under its own in-tree relative path, but its
reported size comes from :func:`os.lstat` (not :func:`os.stat`) — the
symlink's own byte length, never a stat of whatever it points at — so no
metadata about anything outside the tree is ever surfaced. Nothing here
needs ``dir_fd`` chaining: there is no content read and no follow-through
target to escape into.

        """Soft-delete the workspace, then tear down any warm sandbox session.

        Wave 2 Task 4 addition to the marker-write this method already did
        (see module docstring "Marker semantics"): once the marker is on
        disk, a sandbox the user is *currently* using should not keep
        running against a workspace that just got cut loose from purge —
        it would otherwise sit warm (spec's default idle TTL is 15 minutes)
        with no user around to notice, and the next ``acquire`` for this
        ``(tenant, user)`` is refused by ``AgentSandboxClient``'s own
        soft-delete gate anyway, so leaving the *existing* session alive
        would just be an inconsistency window, not a real capability.

        Ordering is deliberate: the marker write happens first and is not
        undone if the teardown below fails. ``mark_deleted``'s only durable
        side effect that matters for correctness is the marker (it is what
        blocks future ``acquire`` calls); the teardown is a best-effort
        cleanup of a session that may not even exist. Letting a teardown
        failure propagate — rather than swallowing it — matters for a
        different reason: ``user_purge.py`` records this step's outcome in
        its per-step failure summary and audits it, and a swallowed
        exception would report success while a running microVM with a stale
        ``EgressContext`` for a purged user's workspace stays up until the
        20-minute platform timeout. The marker having already landed makes
        this safe to retry — retrying only repeats the (idempotent) marker
        write and the teardown lookup, never re-does anything destructive.

        ``runtime``/``instance_store`` both being unset (wave 1/3 default —
        no sandbox runtime wired, e.g. ``persistence_backend="memory"`` or a
        unit test) skips teardown entirely; the marker write above still
        ran. Requiring *both* rather than just ``runtime`` is deliberate:
        ``get_warm`` lives on :attr:`instance_store`, not on
        :attr:`runtime` (:class:`~orchestrator.tools.sandbox.SandboxRuntime`
        has no such method) — one configured without the other is a
        wiring bug this store has no way to recover from, so it degrades
        the same way "neither configured" does rather than raising an
        ``AttributeError`` that would look like a filesystem failure.
